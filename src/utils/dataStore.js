Early beta users report up to 60% reduction in manual processing time. Industry analysts view this as a direct move to capture the SMB automation budget that has historically gone to specialist tools.`,
  'new pricing':              (c) => `${c} announced a revised pricing structure that introduces a usage-based tier alongside its existing flat-rate plans. The move appears designed to lower the entry barrier for smaller customers while increasing revenue from high-volume enterprise clients. Competitors with fixed pricing models may face pressure to respond.`,
  'partnership announcement': (c) => `${c} formalized a strategic partnership that expands its distribution network significantly. The deal grants co-marketing rights and preferred vendor status in a key vertical. Market observers note this reduces ${c}'s dependence on direct sales and accelerates its go-to-market reach by an estimated 40%.`,
  'product launch':           (c) => `${c} shipped a major product update this week, adding features that directly address the top three pain points cited in user research. The launch was coordinated with a content blitz across LinkedIn and Product Hunt, generating substantial early traction. This positions ${c} more directly against established players in the segment.`,
  'hiring spree':             (c) => `${c} posted 23 new job openings in the past 30 days, with the majority concentrated in engineering and growth roles. The hiring pattern suggests an upcoming product expansion or a move into an adjacent market. Tracking competitor hiring is one of the clearest leading indicators of strategic direction.`,
  'blog post published':      (c) => `${c}'s latest long-form content piece attracted significant engagement, with over 4,000 shares across platforms within 48 hours of publication. The piece positions ${c} as a thought leader in the space and appears designed to drive inbound demand for a specific use case. Content-led growth is increasingly central to their acquisition strategy.`,
  'case study released':      (c) => `${c} published a detailed customer success story featuring measurable ROI metrics from a well-known brand. Case studies of this quality are typically released ahead of sales cycles in a target segment, signalling active pursuit of similar accounts. The metrics cited — including a 3.2× return within 90 days — are compelling proof points.`,
  'awards recognition':       (c) => `${c} received recognition from a respected industry body, which will likely accelerate enterprise sales conversations where third-party validation matters in procurement processes. Award listings often appear in analyst reports and RFP shortlists, giving ${c} a credibility signal that is difficult to replicate quickly.`,
